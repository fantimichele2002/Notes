Is a homeobox transcription factor that is critically involved in early embryonic patterning, particularly during gastrulation. It is induced by Nodal/TGF-β signaling and is strongly associated with the formation of the primitive streak, where cells begin to exit pluripotency and differentiate into mesoderm and endoderm. MIXL1 regulates genes required for mesendoderm specification and coordinated cell movements, effectively driving cells away from a pluripotent or neural trajectory toward posterior and internal lineages. Because of this, MIXL1 is widely used as a marker of early mesodermal and endodermal commitment in developmental and stem cell biology.
