Is a transcription factor belonging to the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family that plays a central role in early neural development. It is one of the earliest markers of neuroectoderm and is expressed as pluripotent cells commit to a neural fate. Functionally, SOX1 helps maintain neural progenitor cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state by activating neural-specific gene programs while repressing alternative lineage choices, such as mesoderm or endoderm. In this way, SOX1 acts as a gatekeeper of neural identity during embryogenesis and early nervous system formation.
